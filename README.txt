this file i was do for understanding  how normal directory begin git repository/

open file location where u want to make git repository - click right click then there two git option are available after 
installing git in our PC.

1.  open dirctory as git bash  after first check that u choosen directory is already git repository or not,
thats check using first command (git status) that will show git directory exist or not.  

2. check git version using next command git --version

3. if git repository do not exist then do this directory as git repository and make .git hidden repository .

directory, staging area, commit:

in directory data are change or u wanna commit data then  untracted file are found then use this command -- 
( git add .) 

then in staging area all files are tracked using above git add . command

then tracking fiel are commiting the file such as ex.text we are use this command= 
(git commit -m "ex")
then file is commited
